# tf-lstm-char-cnn

Tensorflow port of Yoon Kim's [Torch7 code](https://github.com/yoonkim/lstm-char-cnn). See also similar project [here](https://github.com/carpedm20/lstm-char-cnn-tensorflow) that failed to reproduce Kim's results and was apparently abandoned by the author. Many pieces of code are borrowed from it.

## Installation
You need tensorflow and python (obviously). The recommended way is to use virtual environment:
```sh
virtualenv .venv -p python3
. .venv/bin/activate
pip install tensorflow
```

## Running

```sh
python train.py -h
python evaluate.py -h
```

## Training

```sh
python train.py
```
will train large model from Yoon Kim's paper.

## Evaluate

```sh
python evaluate.py --load_model cv/epoch024_4.4962.model
```
evaluates this model on the test dataset

## Generate

```sh
python generate.py --load_model cv/epoch024_4.4962.model
```
generates random text from the loaded model

## Model

![model](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/14280777/17991383/13990c56-6b0c-11e6-8a9f-f4de07a6984f.png)

`Model_1` graph is used for inference (computing validation loss and perplexity during training)

`Model` graph is used for training.

## Pre-trained model

Here is a ZIP file containing model files (created with TF 1.0). This model was trained with the default parameters
and acheved the accuracy of the published result.

| Learning rate  |  Train/Valid/Test loss  |  Train/Valid/Test perplexity  |
|:--------------:|:-----------------------:|:------------------------------|
| 1.0            | 3.815 / 4.407 / 4.369   | 35.40 / 82.02 / **79.03**        |

Note that model **DOES** reproduce the published result.

### Training times (legacy, with TF 0.12)

Timings were recorded on AWS EC2 instancies:

1. `c4.8xlarge` - 32 CPUs, no GPUs
2. `g2.2xlarge` - 8 CPU, 1 GPU (K520)
3. `p2.xlarge`  - 4 CPU, 1 GPU (K80)

|   Timing        | `c4.8xlarge` | `g2.2xlarge` | `p2.xlarge` |
|-----------------|--------------|--------------|-------------|
| Secs per batch  | 0.98         | 2.85         | 0.32        |
| Secs per epoch  | 1404         | 3779         | 428         |

Takes 3 hours to complete training (25 epochs) on `p2.xlarge` machine
